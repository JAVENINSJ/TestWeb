Whereas most HTML tags apply meaning (p makes a paragraph, h1 makes a heading etc.), the span and div tags apply no meaning at all. This might sound about as useful as a foam hammer but they are actually used quite extensively in conjunction with CSS.</li>

            <h3>Calculating Values With calc()</h3>

            <p>Another new and awesome CSS feature is the calc() function. It allows you 
            to do simple arithmetic calculations in CSS. You can use it anywhere a 
            length or a size is required. What is even cooler, is that you can freely
            mix different units, like percentages and pixels. This makes a lot of 
            layout hacks that you might have used in the past obsolete. The best news? 
            It works in IE9 and up, prefix-free.</p>

            <p>Learn more about the calc() function 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>
            , or see a

            <h3>Generated Content and Counters</h3>

            <p>Generated content is a powerful tool in the hands of developers, made 
            available by the [::before] and [::after] pseudo elements. This feature 
            lets you use less HTML to achieve the same layouts. This is especially 
            beneficial in cases where you need extra box shadows or other visual 
            elements that would require extra spans or divs. In the end, you get a 
            more minimal and semantically correct HTML.</p>

            <p>CSS3 also gives pseudo elements access to 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Counters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">counters</a>
            , which can be incremented with a CSS rule. They can also access 
            attributes from the parent elements that contain them.</p>

            <p>Generated content is supported everywhere, including IE9 and up.</p>

            <div class="anim2">
                <span data-title="I have a wonderful title!">This is item</span>
                <span data-title="These titles are shown only using CSS, no JavaScript is used!">This is item</span>
                <span data-title="Hello there!">This is item</span>
                <span data-title="Generated content is awesome!">This is item</span>

            <h3>Gradients</h3>
            
            <p>Gradients give web designers the power to create smooth transitions
            between colors without having to resort to images. CSS gradients 
            also look great on retina displays, because they are generated on 
            the fly. They can be linear or radial, and can be set to repeat. 
            They have been around for some time, but after a few minor syntax 
            changes over the last months, they are finally available nearly 
            everywhere, prefix-free!</p>
            
            <div class="grad">
                <div id="el1">Linear</div>
                <div id="el2">Radial</div>
                <div id="el3">Repeating Lin.</div>
                <div id="el4">Repeating Rad.</div>
            </div>
